# Test #2
This test also involved making a screencast of the SegAnnDB testing harness.  Initally, some of the code didn't function properly and in the video I disscuss those issues and how I went about fixing them.

# Test #3
The final test was to add a code coverage utility to SegAnnDB.  I attempted this test, but didn't complete it.  As the testing code is currently written, it calls Firefox and runs its tests through Firefox.  However, the point of a code coverage utility is to monitor the code of SegAnnDB, not Firefox.  Therefore, to get a code coverage utility working would require a complete rewrite of the tests to call the code and webpages directly rather than through Firefox.  This rewrite would take longer than the time constraints of the application deadline.
